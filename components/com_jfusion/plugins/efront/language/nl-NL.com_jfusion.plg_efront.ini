It shall look something like this /home/my_account_name/my_domain_name/efront or /var/www/httpdocs/efront depending on your server setup.

; EFRONT_UPLOAD_PATH_DESC="Needed to find the users Avatars. NOTE: if your setup has the eFront WWW directory as root, eg if the full url to Software points to that directory then the upload directories cannot be reached from the net (secure) and the Avatars cannot be loaded by the Jfusion software."

; EFRONT_AVATAR_URL_DESC="This url should point to the root directory, in above example for type B it will be http://www.yourdomain.com/efront/. Type A installations do not allow avatar access from other software."
; EFRONT_SOURCE_URL_DESC="Refers to the complete URL to eFront. Note that it should point to eFronts base directory, thus if the lowest directory you can access from the web is <root> this should point to <root>/www/. In some setups you can access eFront as <root> if the installation of the server maps the base directory on the root. So it should look something like this http://www.yourdomain.com/efront/www for type B and http://www.yourdomain.com/ for type A (see 'before you begin')"
